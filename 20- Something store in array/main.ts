//Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

// create array 
let picnicPlaces: string[] = ["Clifton", "Hawksbay", "Mubarak village"];

// print a message of list
console.log("List of picnic places:");

// printing the values in the form of list
picnicPlaces.forEach(places => console.log(places));
